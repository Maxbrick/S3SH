# S3SH:- WIP SSH client for 3ds

## Description

This is a full ssh client with vt100 emulation[supporrts colors and  Escape Codes].Works with raspberry pis, etc. This project uses a modified version of the [tmt emulation library](https://github.com/deadpixi/libtmt) to provide with vt100 emulation. 

### crawl.develz.org

This project originally started as a client for this game, but later I repurposed the whole project to serve as a general ssh client. 

The game somewhat works with this client other than the Login option and Register option.
